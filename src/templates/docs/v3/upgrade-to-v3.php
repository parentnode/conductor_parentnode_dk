				Detector v2 and v3 are quite different and yet very similar. Upgrading can typically be done in a couple of 
				hours. The benefit is dealing with less segments in your projects - well, and not being stranded when Detector v2
				is taken out of service (in 2016).
			</p>
			<p>
				Detector v3 comes with an updated set of segments but also allows you to flexibly group these segments to
				match the include-layout used in Detector v2 projects, making it perfectly compatible with your existing
				JavaScript and CSS layout.
			</p>
			<p><a href="http://janitor.parentnode.dk">Janitor v0.7.6</a> uses Detector v3.</p>

			<h2>Step 1</h2>
			<p>
				<a href="/build">Build</a> a custom Detector v3, which maps the new segments to the ones you 
				support in your existing project.
			</p>

			<h2>Step 2</h2>
			<p>
				Update your local Detector v2 request method to use the new static Detector v3 for detection.
			</p>
			<p>
				Shifting from the API service to the static Detector v3 is a matter of upgrading your CMS or
				make the update manually in your project. Instead of requesting the segment from the API, the static Detector v3
				provides a method which handles the segment detection.
			</p>

			<p class="note">
				Updating your CMS may have other implication on your projects. Refer to the CMS documentation
				for additional information. You can also contact us at 
				<a href="mailto:support@parentnode.dk">support@parentnode.dk</a> if you need help upgrading.
