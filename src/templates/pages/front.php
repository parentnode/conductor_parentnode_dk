				<span class="brand">Detector</span> is your one-stop solution to supporting all HTML capable 
				devices on earth and lowering your development complexity at the same time. Yes, that includes
				old mobile phones dominating 3rd world countries as well as the latest WebGL enabled browsers
				- all bundled up neatly in 13 segments with each their own defined set of charactaristics.
			</p>


			<h2>If mobile is the new black, then what's the new mobile?</h2>
			<p>
				Internet browsing trends change faster than a typical website lifespan. Tomorrow some new browsing
				gadget might surface and then what do you do with your old website?
			</p>
			<p>
				Websites are no longer just one-size fits all and they should not be. It might seem like a jungle 
				of different devices with different screen resolutions, input methods, rendering capabilities and
				processing power, but we are here to help simplify things. <span class="brand">Detector</span> is this multitude of available 
				devices boiled down to logical and groupable <a href="/docs/segments">segments</a>. On each project you 
				individually decide which segments your project needs to support and how.
			</p>
			<p>
				Detector is designed on top of a mobile-first markup approach, with no limits. Forget current design and 
				implementation issues and focus on building optimized interfaces for each segment. 
				<span class="brand">Detector</span> lets you separate your JavaScript and CSS into naturally deducted device 
				segments, leaving the complexity of intertwined responsive states across platforms as a curious 
				remnant of the troubled past.
