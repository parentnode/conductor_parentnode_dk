				Detector is your one-stop solution to supporting all HTML capable devices on earth and lowering 
				your development complexity at the same time.
			</p>

			<h2>If mobile is the new black, then what's the new mobile?</h2>
			<p>
				Websites are no longer just one-size fits all and they should not be. It might seem like a jungle 
				of different devices with different screen resolutions, input methods, rendering capabilities and
				processing power. <span class="brand">Detector</span> is this multitude of available 
				devices boiled down to <a href="/segments">9 easy-to-manage segments</a>. You decide which
				segments your project needs to support.
			</p>
			<p>
				Detector is designed on top of a mobile-first markup approach, with no limits. Forget current design and 
				implementation issues and focus on building optimized interfaces for each segment. 
				<span class="brand">Detector</span> lets you separate your JavaScript and CSS into naturally deducted device 
				segments, leaving the complexity of intertwined responsive states as a curious remnant of the past.
