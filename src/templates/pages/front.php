	<h2>If mobile is the new black, then what's the new mobile?</h2>
	<p>
		Websites are no longer just one-size fits all - it's a jungle of different devices with
		different properties. <span class="brand">Conductor</span> is this multitude of available devices with different screen resolutions, input methods and rendering capabilities 
		boiled down to <a href="/conductor/segments">9 easy-to-manage segments</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Conductor is designed for a mobile-first approach, with no limits. Forget current design and implementation
		issues and focus on building optimized interfaces. <span class="brand">Conductor</span> lets you separate 
		your frontend code into natural device segments, leaving the complexity of intertwined responsive states
		as a curious remnant of the past.
