	<h1>Detector is devices made simple</h1>
	<p>
		Detector is your one-stop solution to supporting all HTML capable devices on earth and lowering 
		your development complexity at the same time.
	</p>

	<h2>If mobile is the new black, then what's the new mobile?</h2>
	<p>
		Websites are no longer just one-size fits all and they should not be. It might seem like a jungle 
		of different devices with different screen resolutions, input methods, rendering capabilities and
		processing power. <span class="brand">Detector</span> is this multitude of available 
		devices boiled down to <a href="/detector/segments">9 easy-to-manage segments</a>. You decide which
		segments your project needs to support.
	</p>
	<p>
		Detector is designed on top of a mobile-first markup approach, with no limits. Forget current design and 
		implementation issues and focus on building optimized interfaces for each segment. 
		<span class="brand">Detector</span> lets you separate your frontend code into naturally deducted device 
		segments, leaving the complexity of intertwined responsive states as a curious remnant of the past.
