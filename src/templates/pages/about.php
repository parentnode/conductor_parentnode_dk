				Detector was founded to make segments available to the public. After having worked with Detector 
				for 6 years, it has proven to be a strong and valid concept, without any real competitors in the market. Now
				you can reap the benifits as well.
			</p>
			<p>
				Detector is made available to improve internet solutions around the world. It's not a business and it is
				not supposed to be a business. It is an idealistic approach, made real with a lot of patience and hard
				work. We believe that is the best way to implement real changes.
			</p>
			<p>
				In spite of this idealistic approach, the cost of running the service needs to be covered. This is done
				through sponsors and by requiring a minimal load-based fee for corporate clients.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Detector service is hosted in a load-balanced environment in coorporation with Rackspace. The servers
				are monitored and optimized for reliability and ultra fast responses, running on second year with 
				zero unscheduled downtime.
