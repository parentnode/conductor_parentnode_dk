	<h1>About Detector</h1>
	<p>
		Detector was founded to make segments available to the public. After having worked with Detector 
		for 6 years, it has proven to be a strong and valid concept, without any real competitors in the market. Now
		you can reap the benifits as well.
	</p>
	<p>
		Detector is made available to improve internet solutions around the world. It's not a business and it is
		not supposed to be a business. It is an idealistic approach, made real with a lot of patience and hard
		work. We believe that is the best way to implement real changes.
	</p>
	<p>
		In spite of this idealistic approach, the cost of running the service needs to be covered. This is done
		through sponsors and by requiring a minimal load-based fee for corporate clients.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Detector service is hosted in a load-balanced environment in coorporation with Rackspace. The servers
		are monitored and optimized for reliability and ultra fast responses, running on second year with 
		zero unscheduled downtime.
	</p>

	<p>
		We are always looking for new business or development partners, so feel free to contact us with any questions, suggestions or
		comments.
