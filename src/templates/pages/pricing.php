	<h1>Pricing</h1>

	<p>
		The purpose of our pricing plan is to make Detector availble to everyone, but still accepting we do need a 
		little money to keep the service alive and ensure fast responses. Crudely speaking, our policy is: 
		if you are in it for the money you have to pay, while idealists ride for free.
		Startups and small businesses can hitch a freeride until they reach a certain point of success.
	</p>
	<p>
		Obviously our pricing plan considers our hosting expences, but this project is not based on an 
		economy centered businessplan. It is more important to provide solutions, than to make money.
		You can start using our service today but we recommend you contact us, before we contact you.
